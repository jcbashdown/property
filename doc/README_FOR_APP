Rails 3, ruby 1.9.2.

The database config is currently set to root, no password, mysql2, mysqld.sock.
Make a property_development database and a property_test one if you want to
play with the (rather limited) tests. Only one vaguely interesting model
method was written 'block.document_types' so only this was tested (and should
probably have been a scope anyway). A bit more work would mean some
controller testing (mainly for the documents controller) and a few more
view helpers - got a little complex there. Also, some custom validations
would be good to add (particularly with regard to what can have certain
document types.

Adding records can be done through the links on this Index page, they should
only display in cases where appropriate. Upload is handled through paperclip,
download through this index page again (as well as document destruction, document
type addition (at the bottom of the page) and destruction) and add, edit, show and
delete (basic restful stuff) for blocks. Out of date fire certificates should
display in *bold and red* and expiry date should only be an option for these
(select a date in the past for this type when uploading to show this).

As mentioned earlier document types can be added at the bottom of the page and this
allows a 'valid_from' and an 'allow_expiry'. The first to cover things like asbestos
reports - new government regulations which are not retrospective - and the second
for things like fire certification - that which needs renewing.
